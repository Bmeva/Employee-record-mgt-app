lesson two
creating react front end

delete the Front end folder that was created
npx create-react-app frontendapp which would create a new folder called frontend app inside our project
it would install the neccesary packages such as react-dom, reat, react-script etc
when you open the folder the first one is node_modules which contains all packages that comes
with a react app
 next is the public folder which comes with all out static files
 you would see images, index.html and icon file

 the src file is where we would develop out application
 at the bottom you would see other files such as gitignore and json files


 to run our front end server cd into the folder

 cd frontendapp
 cd .. would take you out of the folder
 then npm start

 if it gives you a prompt to allow click on it

 it would open through http://localhost:3000


to change the wrte up on the home page 
 go to src and open app.js file

 in the edit write up delete it and add yours

 to change everything go to your app.js file to the below

 
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <div>Hello react</div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;


next create a folder called components inside the src folder

now we need to create a communication between the front end and backend
bcos as you see django runs on port 8000 and react on 3000. they are completly decoupled

open a new terminal 
pip install django-cors-headers

if it dont install on vs code use gitbash

next add it to installed app section

  "corsheaders",

  add this to the middleware section and it has to be the first
   "corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware",


   add this. the url is the react server url

   CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
    'http://localhost:3000'
]

now front end and backend should be able to communicate

LESSON THREE

now we need to install a package called react router dom which would enable us navigate 
various pages 

cd into the frontend app
type npm i react-router-dom

to use react router go to 
 index.js

At the top import 
import {BrowserRouter as Router} from 'react-router-dom';

next wrap the entire code in a router

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <Router>
    <React.StrictMode>
      <App />
    </React.StrictMode>
  </Router>
);

next we would create a number of files in our component folder


type this on the Home.js

import React from "react";
const Home =() => {
    return (
        <div>Home</div>
    )
}

export default Home

create another page in the component folder and call it About.js and add the following code 

import React from "react";
const About = () => {
    return (
        <div>About</div>
    )
}

export default About



Create another page and call it Create.js this is the page where we would create some employee records

and add the following code 


now we would write some logic that would display the different pages that we have created.

we would write it in the app.js file and th app.js file acts like our urls.py file in django

import all the pages first 

import About from './components/About';
import Create from './components/Create';
import Home from './components/home';
import Landing from './components/Landing';

remove the 
<div>Hello react</div>

and add the following 

 <Routes>
        <Route path='' element={<Home />} />
        <Route path='/about' element={<About />} />
        <Route path='/landing' element={<Landing />} />
        <Route path='/create' element={<Create />} />



      </Routes>


cd into the frontendapp and run npm start. if it dont start and gives error type

 npm audit fix --force

 then run npm start which would land you on the home page
 type /about
 type /landing

 type /create

 which would take you to the different pages


 Lesson four - Material UI navbar

 material UI allows us to use pre built components in our react js application
 1. install material Ui at https://mui.com/material-ui/
 Stop your server and paste the code npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

 which installs material UI and also emotion react which is used to write 
 javascript and css codes

 now we need to install material UI icon libraries just as we have font awesome
 icons

 if you scroll down the installation sectiion you would see the code where to
  install the library for icons. copy and install npm install @mui/icons-material

  npm install @mui/icons-material
  
  ADDING NAVBAR
  go back to the material ui library and click on get started
  Click on components, go to the navigation section and click on drawer
  scroll to the clipped under the Persistent drawer 

  copy the code and pase inside navbar.js

delete the typograpgy

remove the divider with the list at the bottom of the divider
<List>
                        {['All mail', 'Trash', 'Spam'].map((text, index) => (
                            <ListItem key={text} disablePadding>
                                <ListItemButton>
                                    <ListItemIcon>
                                        {index % 2 === 0 ? <InboxIcon /> : <MailIcon />}
                                    </ListItemIcon>
                                    <ListItemText primary={text} />
                                </ListItemButton>
                            </ListItem>
                        ))}
                    </List>

  delete this  {['Inbox', 'Starred', 'Send email', 'Drafts'].map((text, index) => (

    and this   ))}   it loops over the function but delete it so we hard code ours
    delete this icon as well 
    {index % 2 === 0 ? <InboxIcon /> : <MailIcon />}

    and this as well key={text} disablePadding

    in here type "Home"

    <ListItemText primary={"text"} />

     <ListItemText primary={"Home"} />

     go back to material UI library and search for home icon

     https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/  

     copy the code and import the icon library at the top

     import HomeWorkIcon from '@mui/icons-material/HomeWork';

     type  <HomeWorkIcon/> inbetween the ListItemIcon

       
                            <ListItem>
                                <ListItemButton>

                                    <ListItemIcon>
                                        <HomeWorkIcon/>
                                    </ListItemIcon>
                                    <ListItemText primary={"Home"} />
                                </ListItemButton>
                            </ListItem>
                      
                    </List>


next we need to add a link so go to the top section and import

import { Link, useLocation} from 'react-router-dom';

below the export default function add 

  const location = useLocation()
    const path = location.pathname

in the list item button add   <ListItemButton component = {Link} to ="/" selected = {"/" === path}>


now copy the list item code for the create and about us pages 

<ListItem>
                                <ListItemButton component = {Link} to ="" selected = {"" === path}>

                                    <ListItemIcon>
                                        <HomeWorkIcon/>
                                    </ListItemIcon>
                                    <ListItemText primary={"Home"} />
                                </ListItemButton>
                            </ListItem>

delete the imports that you dont use which are greyed out


add disablePadding to the list items

you can change the name of the export default function to Navi if you want

Next go to app.js and import the navbar

import Navi from './components/navbar';  component names must start with capital letters

on your app.js under the   <div className="App">

<Navi/>



Now we want all the navbar pages to be within the navbar so 
above the export default function in your app.js add this

interface NaviProps {
    children: React.ReactNode;
}

comment out export default function Navi() { 

  and add 
  export default function Navi({ children }: NaviProps) {


go to the bottom of the navbar.tst where you have  <DrawerHeader />


and below it add

      {children}

      Now go to the app.js and add 
       <Navi />


      </Navi>
within the <Navi> tags add the urls

 <Navi>

      <Routes>

        <Route path="" element={<Home />} />


        <Route path="/aboutpage" element={<About />} />

        <Route path="/Createrecord" element={<Create />} />

        <Route path="/Services" element={<Services />} />


      </Routes>
    </Navi>
